# rongolab

Standalone Bauhaus-style web tool for Rongorongo research: upload tablet/glyph images, select &amp; crop a symbol, tweak contrast/threshold, and get quick shape-matching suggestions from a glyph library. Build sequences, add notes, and map your own glossary values. Imports/exports JSON. No backend; runs in-browser.

## RongoLab

Standalone, in-browser helper for exploring Rongorongo glyph images:
- Upload an image (tablet/glyph photo)
- Select a region (glyph)
- Apply quick preprocessing
- Get simple shape-matching suggestions against a glyph library
- Build and annotate a glyph sequence with a user-defined glossary

## Reality check
Rongorongo is widely considered undeciphered.
This project is a visual matching + annotation tool, not a definitive translator.
